				This is a response to Chapter 2 of <i>Artful Design</i>,
				<b>Expressive Toys</b>". <br />
				<br />
				I will be responding to Principle 2.4: Take Advantage of
				<b>Physicality</b><br />
				<br />
				There exists a trichotomy between the absolutes of nature,
				virtuality, and the inbetween. Even today, in our increasingly
				globalized world, one can find themselves in the grip of nature;
				pure, blissful, harsh, nourishing. However, one can also choose
				the infinity of virtual reality. Most may choose to exist in the
				middle: they might binge a
				<i>HBO</i> limited series, or they might mountain bike. They
				might choose to go to a concert, however they might also watch
				most of that concert through the video camera in their phone.
				Upon closer inspection you can see features that can traverse
				all three camps. The beautiful natural world reclaims unused
				stretches of tarmac, and technology models natural phenomena.
				Principle 2.4 from <i>Artful Design</i> instructs us to
				“artfully blend the physical with the virtual'' (pg. 80). Video
				games present a medium to achieve this. <br />
				<br />
				<i>Aaru</i> and <i>The Field of Reeds</i>, an epitome of the
				sublime, merges the natural and unnatural. Golden fields and an
				ever-setting sun glisten on the giant statues protruding out of
				the ground. <i>Minecraft</i> gives us an infinite world with
				infinite possibilities. Design is the name of the game. There is
				an underpinning value of exploration which both of these games
				present the user. Physicality has become virtualized down to
				bits flowing through the processor of the computer. Likewise,
				the bits flowing through billions of transistors have then been
				given a physical body in the virtual game. While there are
				quests, milestones, missions, goals, and achievements to unlock
				in the game, a connoisseur of the sublime will see that the true
				power lies in the untold possibilities of exploration, and the
				inspiration which comes from having the ability to appreciate
				what the natural world could offer us if we were to open our
				eyes to it. Reflecting on this reading left me with the question
				of who or what exerts a force on us physically and virtually,
				and what it is that pushes back.<br />
				<br />
				Newton’s Third Law of Motion states that for every action there
				is an equal and opposite reaction. The more we master the art of
				blending the physical with the virtual, the more we lose the
				ability to determine what is natural and what is not.
				<i>Artful Design</i> postulates that “Profound technology
				disappears,” (pg. 64). I am left wondering what is the “right”
				path to commit to. What is the place of nature, technology, and
				the artful design of both? How are we to employ the right
				balance of all so as to not lose our beginnings completely? If
				we push too far to one extreme, what will push back. I have
				solace in the belief that the principle of
				<b>taking advantage of physicality</b> requires us to
				<b>explore the physicality of our surroundings.</b>
