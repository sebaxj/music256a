        This is a response to Chapter 8 of <i>Artful Design</i>, Manifesto and
        <b>Coda</b>.<br />
        <br />
        I will be responding to Principle 8.9: <b>Technology</b> is about what
        we <i>CAN</i> do. <b>Morality</b> is about what we <i>OUGHT</i> to
        do.<br />
        <br />
        <i>
          “We want <b>MORE</b>,”<br />
          “– of what? I don’t know!”<br />
          “Just… <b>MORE</b>”<br />
          <br />
          – page 403</i
        ><br />
        <br />

        The infamous <b>Hippocratic Oath</b> is a ceremonial oath of ethics
        taken by physicians to <i>“do no harm.”</i> Our society, however, seems
        to place lawyers, billionaires, programmers, and physicians on the same
        pedestal, with only the latter being bound to such ethical standards as
        the <b>Hippocratic Oath</b>. In this essay, I will explore the themes of
        <b>design</b>, technology, and morality as they are explored in chapter
        8 of <i>Artful Design</i>. <br />
        <br />
        When we play the role of <b>designer</b>, we become a creator in a
        similar sense to the popular notion of a God. Some juxtapose the concept
        of a divine creator as a hand which wound up a grandfather clock – the
        universe. I believe it is an important distinction to make between
        active divine intervention versus a “set it and forget it” mentality. In
        Music 256A at Stanford University, we often found ourselves playing the
        role of a <b>“Humanist Engineer”</b> and an
        <b>“Artful Designer”</b> (pg. 426). However, the ethos of this chapter
        relates back to the distinction between one who releases their creation
        into the world at the mercy of the people, versus the creator who
        designs technology bound by <b>moral</b> standards. <br />
        <br />
        I disagree that morality is the stuff of reason as stated on page 410.
        Interestingly, however, it is later written that
        <i>“morality has to be a choice”</i>. I believe that if one were to look
        at morality completely objectively – say, if one were to be raised in an
        environment with no notion of morality – morality would become
        nonsensical. However, as diligent scholars of <i>Artful Design</i>, we
        are bound to an oath of ethical and moral design much in the same way
        the <b>Hippocratic Oath</b> functions for physicians. The same paragraph
        about morality later states the importance of true morality in its
        authenticity and unconditional consciences. What we practice everyday
        compounds. Thus, it is essential that morality isn’t a fleeting feeling,
        but one we pledge to practice day after day.<br />
        <br />
        In the <b>Coda</b>, a quote from Katha Upanishad (800-300 BC) stuck with
        me:<br />
        <br />
        <i
          >“The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to traverse; thus the wise
          say the path to enlightenment is hard.”<br />
          <br />
          – page 456</i
        ><br />
        <br />
        Along with all the physical and superficial beauty in the artificial and
        natural world, the dimension of morality is as important to the
        stability of our Universe as gravity and time; without morality in the
        technology we design, the father we will stray from
        <b>The Human Condition</b>.
