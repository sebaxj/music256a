        This is a response to Chapter 8 of <i>Artful Design</i>, Manifesto and
        <b>Coda</b>.<br />
        <br />
        I will be responding to Principle 7.14: <b>Technology</b> is about what
        we <i>CAN</i> do. <b>Morality</b> is about what we <i>OUGHT</i> to
        do.<br />
        <br />

        “We want <b>MORE</b>,”<br />
        “– of what? I don’t know!”<br />
        “Just… <b>MORE</b>”<br />
        <br />
        – page 403
        <br />

        The infamous <b>Hippocratic Oath</b> is a ceremonial oath of ethics
        taken by physicians to <i>“do no harm.”</i> Our society, however, seems
        to place lawyers, billionaires, programmers, and physicians on the same
        pedestal, with only the former being exempt from such ethical standards
        as the <b>Hippocratic Oath</b>. In this essay, I will explore the themes
        of <b>design</b>, technology, and morality as they are explored in
        chapter 8 of <i>Artful Design</i>. <br />
        <br />
        When we play the role of <b>designer</b>, we become a creator in a
        similar sense to the popular notion of a God. Some juxtapose the concept
        of a divine creator as a hand which wound up a grandfather clock – the
        universe. I believe it is an important distinction to make between
        active divine intervention versus a “set it and forget it” mentality. In
        Music 256A and Stanford University, we often found ourselves playing the
        role of a <b>“Humanist Engineer”</b> and an
        <b>“Artful Designer”</b> (pg. 426). However, the ethos of chapter 8 of
        <i>Artful Design</i> relates back to the distinction between one who
        releases their creation into the world at the mercy of the people,
        versus the creator who designs <b>moral</b> technology.
