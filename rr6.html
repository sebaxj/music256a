				This is a response to Chapter 6 of <i>Artful Design</i>, Game
				<b>Design</b>.<br />
				<br />
				I will be responding to Principle 6.5: <b>Reflection:</b> Games
				as a Mirror of Our Humanness<br />
				<br />
				I grew up in Stowe, Vermont; a small town in a small state. I
				lived a rural childhood where we grew up playing in the woods,
				running through fields, building forts and fires, and of course,
				always managing to scrape something and return home bloodied. My
				siblings and I spent so much time outside that there was a stage
				in my life where I felt like I understood the outdoors better
				than I did the face I saw in the mirror.
				<br />
				<br />
				On my twelfth birthday I asked my parents to buy me a
				<i>Minecraft</i> account. At the time, the $25.00 it cost for a
				lifetime of access seemed priceless. However, I would come to
				learn that the purest aspects of the game, the principles which
				drove <i>Notch</i> – the Java programmer of <i>Minecraft</i> –
				to create the game, were what gave me a better understanding of
				the face staring back at me in the mirror <b><i>AND</i></b> the
				its place in the world. Building subterranean tunnels thousands
				of blocks long, or traversing entire oceans in search of the
				famous Mushroom islands were paramount over the pillaging and
				combat which many saw as the sole purpose of <i>Minecraft</i>.
				<br />
				<br />
				Chapter 6 of <i>Artful Design</i> articulates aspects of game
				<b>design</b>, juxtaposing the job of a game <b>designer</b> to
				that of a puppeteer. I would like to briefly address the
				question posed on page 306, “How do we design play?” Just like
				great pieces of literature, movies, and music, games may act as
				an expressive medium of one's experience – as is the case in
				<i>That Dragon, Cancer</i>, as a tool, or as an attempt to
				answer the questions of how life is designed; not only that, but
				what can life <i>actually</i> be. Kunwoo Kim’s Wednesday lecture
				on <i>Game <b>Design</b></i> similarly stated that we are better
				able to put up with sadness, pain, and suffering in games as we
				are better able to understand it without fearing it. <br />
				<br />
				While being well versed in bushcraft at a young age allowed me
				to live out my <i>Bear Grylls</i> fantasies, video games such as
				<i>Minecraft</i> taught me valuable lessons about the importance
				of being constructive versus destructive, and the likely reality
				of losing everything you desire and starting over in life.
				<br />
				<br />
				As I dig deeper into our third homework assignment in Music
				256A, the development of an audio sequencer, I hope to employ
				the principles of game <b>design</b> I found most important in
				chapter 6: an articulation of what we believe life to be and a
				guess of what we believe life can be. <br />
