      <p>
        So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning ChucK/Unity/Chunity. I found
        the tutorials pretty straight forward and I love having the newfound
        power/ability to create multi-dimensional interactive projects where
        sound and visuals work in tandem. I do enjoy the scripting more than the
        3D modeling, mainly because I find it harder to strike a balance between
        functionality and aesthetics where as code is more straight forward.
        However, I am consistently having the problem of Unity not running
        smoothly on my system. I find that the editor is laggy, and Play Mode is
        laggy as well resulting in very choppy frames. I am still looking into
        how to optimize/fix this.

      <h3 id="Ideas">Ideas for my Sound Visualizer</h3>
      <p>
        The Sound Visualizer project presents me with the unique opportunity to
        explore my primary interest at school, Pre-med, in the domain of music,
        my major. As such, my ideas reflect my desire to visualize how music
        affects our bodies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Brain: my first idea involves using the visualizer to literally
          explore artistically the impact of music on the brain. I want to not
          only visualize the time and frequency domain of music, but also the
          domain emotion in the music and reflect that into a model the brain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Basilar Membrane: my second idea is to present the frequency domain as
          modeled cochlear basilar membrane to illustrate how our ears 'FFT-ize'
          sound. For the time domain I want to incorporate a beating heart and
          display the waveform as electrical impulses.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I have officially "broken ground" on my Visualizer! In the above
        screenshot you can see the general form my project is taking. I managed
        to create a cube with a material which I created from a picture of a
        brain. This is the general layout I want my project to create. Next,
        however, I want to split the image into each hemisphere of the brain on
        two separate cubes to be able to move them along with music. The
        waveform will be anchored between the hemispheres, and I am still
        brainstorming where I will put the frequency domain. Ideally, I want the
        frequency domain to form the "spinal cord" flowing down from the brain
        and dissipating outwards.
