      <h3>A Final Note</h3>
      This was a project which definitely had its ups and downs and starts and
      restarts. In fact, just a few hours before the final was due, I
      accidentally deleted the whole project and had to reverse engineer my
      visualizer from old builds. I started with the idea of wanting to convey
      the connection between music, the brain, and the heart. However I believe
      that my over-eagerness about the topic had chiseled out an unrealistic
      standard for what I could complete and I ended up starting from scratch a
      week ago with a new idea â€“ nonetheless one I was still passionate about. I
      wanted to explore the symbolism behind the hands of God and Adam on the
      ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The imagery of solely their hands is more
      recognizable than most western art. As such, I wanted to unravel the
      intricacies of their design. Initially I had trouble adjusting to the
      paradigm or working in a powerful graphics editor such as Unity, and
      writing C# scripts; the disconnect was difficult. However, I soon came
      appreciate a balance of both and had a lot of fun seeing how far I could
      push graphic design (an art I have't attempted thus far in my life) and
      programming intentional <b>design</b><br />
