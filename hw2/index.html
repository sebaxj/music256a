      <p>
        So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning ChucK/Unity/Chunity. I found
        the tutorials pretty straight forward and I love having the newfound
        power/ability to create multi-dimensional interactive projects where
        sound and visuals work in tandem. I do enjoy the scripting more than the
        3D modeling, mainly because I find it harder to strike a balance between
        functionality and aesthetics where as code is more straight forward.
        However, I am consistently having the problem of Unity not running
        smoothly on my system. I find that the editor is laggy, and Play Mode is
        laggy as well resulting in very choppy frames. I am still looking into
        how to optimize/fix this.

      <h3 id="Ideas">Ideas for my Sound Visualizer</h3>
      <p>
        The Sound Visualizer project presents me with the unique opportunity to
        explore my primary interest at school, Pre-med, in the domain of music,
        my major. As such, my ideas reflect my desire to visualize how music
        affects our bodies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Brain: my first idea involves using the visualizer to literally
          explore artistically the impact of music on the brain. I want to not
          only visualize the time and frequency domain of music, but also the
          domain emotion in the music and reflect that into a model the brain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Basilar Membrane: my second idea is to present the frequency domain as
          modeled cochlear basilar membrane to illustrate how our ears 'FFT-ize'
          sound. For the time domain I want to incorporate a beating heart and
          display the waveform as electrical impulses.
        </li>
      </ul>
