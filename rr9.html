        This is a response to <i>Humans in the Loop</i> by Ge Wang, and
        <i>Experimental Creative Writing with the Vectorized Word</i> by Allison
        Parrish<br />
        <br />
        I will be responding to the conversation of human-mediated algorithmic
        design as discussed in the essay, <i>Humans in the Loop</i> by Ge Wang,
        and video
        <i>Experimental Creative Writing with the Vectorized Word</i> by Allison
        Parrish<br />
        <br />
        The image above is from <i>Artful Design</i>, and is the basis for the
        essay <i>Humans in the Loop</i> by Ge Wang. The pinnacle of discussion
        in Music 256A at the Center for Computer Research in Computer Music
        (CCRMA – pronounced “karma”) at Stanford University is the balance
        between technological intelligence and human agency in the domain of
        creativity and <b>design</b>. The essay
        <i>Humans in the Loop</i> discusses two types of artificial
        intelligence:
      </p>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>Full Automation: AI as a Big Red Button</li>
        <li>Designing with a Human in the Loop</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The former refers to the concept of designing a “perfect” algorithm so
        one only needs to press a big red button to automate the complete and
        absolute execution of a task. The latter refers to a continuous cycle of
        execution and feedback where AI is a tool which extends our own human
        agency. Such is the case in Alison Parish’s vectorized creative writing.
        Parish uses an algorithm which places the phonetics of words into a
        vector space and creates literary pieces based on human-generated
        expressions which manipulate words based on their defined vector.
        However, both the essay and the video failed to touch on a rather
        important aspect of both full automation and designing with a human in
        the loop: what initiates the <i>need</i> or <i>desire</i> for design in
        the first place – the human or the algorithm? I liken this dilemma to
        that of potential, kinetic, and activation energy in the laws of
        physics. An object of immense potential energy may forever remain at
        rest if the proper activation energy is not applied.<br />
        <br />
        Earlier in <i>Artful Design</i> it was stated that the ability to design
        grants us the power of a God. However, it was never discussed what would
        persuade us to divinely create in the first place – <i>why</i> start? I
        believe that the answer to this question is the inherent curiosity of
        human nature. Therefore, the concept of a big red button would never be
        fruitful for two reasons. First, there would always have to be
        spontaneous human desire to press the button, and there would have to be
        a <b>Theory of Mind</b><a href="#sectiona">[A]</a> – unique to the
        <b>Human Condition</b> – to initiate a design of such an algorithm. In
        other words, the creation and implementation of perfect and absolute
        algorithms for design <b>CANNOT</b> exist in a vacuum. Instead, such
        algorithms extend our own creativity and curiosity.
