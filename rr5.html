				This is a response to Chapter 5 of <i>Artful Design</i>,
				Interface <b>Design</b>.<br />
				<br />
				I will be responding to Principle 5.18: Re-Mutalize! Input +
				Output + Human.<br />
				<br />
				<i>Artful Design</i> states <b>Re-Mutalization</b> as “a
				commitment to designing the interface as a whole – and with the
				<b>human</b> as an integral part of the system,” (pg. 244). To
				explore this idea, let us use the piano as a case study. Used
				earlier in Chapter 5, the piano models an interface: “the
				membrane of interaction between human and technology,” (pg.
				206). An interface contains an input controller, mapping of
				input to output, and output (traditionally, acoustic sound
				created by a vibrating string or air speed). The piano’s input
				controller is fully accessible to the player with 88 different
				ivory keys. The keys are in turn mapped to 88 triplets of
				strings of various lengths which are responsible for 88
				different frequencies which can be played in any combination to
				create single notes, or multitudes or chords. The mapping is
				abstracted from the player, creating a seamless delivery of
				output from input. However, though the mapping is hidden from
				the player, it is predictable; a certain input will create the
				same output every time. The predictability of the piano is what
				allows a newcomer or advanced player to use the same interface
				while playing music of varying difficulty. In this essay, I will
				propose a different paradigm of interface <b>design</b>.<br />
				<br />
				As stated by Principle 5.1 from <i>Artful Design</i>,
				<b>interaction is a loop</b>. A player starts with an intention
				– even if seemingly random keys are played in sequence, the act
				of pressing a piano key is intention. The product of intention
				is action, followed by the perception of our action which acts
				as feedback to inform our next intention. However, what if the
				instrument learned from the human. What would this entail? In
				accordance with Principle 5.5, I am proposing puting
				<b>machine learning</b> into the interaction loop! In this
				paradigm, I am hybridizing Perry Cook’s
				<b>Principles of Design</b> to use an existing instrument to
				inform an old controller which manipulates a new algorithm.
				Suppose a digital representation of a piano where the input
				controller and output mimics that of a traditional piano, but
				the mapping is instead a series of disconnected input and output
				nodes. As the player begins to tap keys with varying velocities
				and combinations, a machine learning algorithm would connect
				input nodes with output nodes to yield a complete instrument
				unique to its player’s style, cadence, and emotion.<br />
				<br />
				The <b>Re-Mutalized</b> piano is a thought experiment into
				holistic interface design.<br />
