      <p>
        This is a response to Chapter 1 of Artful Design, "Design is ____".
        <br />
        <br />
        I will be responding to Principle 1.13, "Design is Human"<br />
        <br />
        “Design is Human” (pg. 46). I thought it fitting to start with this
        definition of design which is presented to us in Chapter 1, especially
        as it conflicts with what I once thought of as design, and what I still
        think of as design. Firstly, I would like to treat design as an entity
        entirely separate from the intentions and forces of humanity. I believe
        there are traits we share with design, and traits we don’t. However, I
        believe that our definition of design is solely based on the traits we
        see common to ourselves, juxtaposed to anything we “design”. For
        example, the epitome of human beauty has long been considered a product
        of symmetry; the more symmetrical one’s face and body, the more
        objective beauty they have. The same can be said about design, both
        natural and artificial. Flowers, ferns, and honeycombs all exemplify
        natural symmetry. The same can be said about pyramids, ancient
        buildings, and bridges. From this we may assume that humans aren’t the
        only architects of design. Rather, “Design is created. Design is
        experienced. Design is a thing in motion” (pg 51). I believe that just
        as we design buildings, paint art, play music, program software; design
        has its turn in shaping humanity. We should design to experience the
        emotions and aesthetics in design, but we can’t be so foolish as to
        believe that design isn’t observing us as well, as stated in Chapter 1
        of Artful Design. When I was younger I remember watching the “Night in
        the Museum” with my family and still to this day questioning if the
        world around us is in fact as it appears to us, or if its true form is
        outside the dimensions of human perception, or if in fact we as humans
        are the subjects of other entities looking in on us. <br />
        <br />
        We devise a function to progress “as a society”. Over time, the jobs of
        painters, musicians, architects, poets, and philosophers has been to
        create a form for that function which enhances its usefulness. Form and
        function operate in an infinite feedback loop, but only once we are
        satisfied with both may we begin the cycle over again, devising a new
        function to progress “as a society” further. Like Maslow’s hierarchy of
        needs, one can’t simply create endlessly without taking the (sometimes
        monotonous) time to sculpt and evolve the form into function; like a
        Renaissance sculptor chipping out what is not to leave what is supposed
        to be. <br />
        <br />
        Reading and reflecting on this chapter gave me assurance that there is
        not only a desire for design to “artify” our surroundings and make what
        we do everyday more enjoyable, but also a need for that function to be
        well designed: we need to FEEL it, become INSPIRED by it, become CURIOUS
        because of it. <br />

      <h4 id="part1-part2">Taking Notice to Means and Ends</h4>
      <p>
        My Violin: <br />
        I believe that my violin is the epitome of the dichotomy between
        means-to-an-end and end-in-itself. Without form, there would be no
        function beyond kindling for fire on a desperate, cold, Vermont winter
        night. However, without function, the form would be incomprehensible.
        The balance between form and function and function and form is the
        signature of the luthier, and foundation of my relationship with the
        instrument. Interestingly, however, one needs not understand both to
        experience both. If one were to close their eyes, the function they hear
        would well inform the expected form. If I were to see the violin on
        display, I would have an expectation of the function I would hear from
        the instrument. <br />
        <br />
        My weightlifting shoes: <br />
        There are those who believe that shoes merely serve the purpose of
        covering our feet, and there are those who buy shoes, put them in glass
        cases, never to be worn. I don’t fall into either camp. My weightlifting
        shoes are built with purpose – I bought them for the very purpose they
        were created for. However, over time, I have come to realize an
        emotional connection to every scuff mark, imperfection, and horrid smell
        connected to the pair. They are not the shoes I bought – they are my
        shoes. Their beauty to me, built over hours in the gym, far surpasses
        any superficial desire to mend or replace them – at least not until
        absolutely necessary. <br />
        <br />
        My room: <br />
        My room falls under the category of “controlled mess”. My room doesn’t
        take on one, two, or three functions. There aren’t enough words to
        describe what functions my room offers me. It is a creative studio when
        I feel claustrophobic. It is an escape when I feel overwhelmed. It is
        nothing when I have too much. It is safe when I feel I have nothing. My
        room is my ongoing experiment into Artful Design. I alter my room to
        take on various forms and functions to fit my needs and desires, both
        present and future. My room has four walls which everyone can see, but
        only I know of the deep crevasses which truly give my room its power and
        character. <br />

      <h4 id="part3-guerilla">Guerilla Design: A Text Message</h4>
      <p>
        For the final part of Design Etude #1, I present a text message to my
        roommate which has been "artified". Instead of summarizing my day (or
        just sending an audio message if I'm feeling EXTRA lazy), I decided to
        add another dimension: DESIGN.
