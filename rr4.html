				This is a response to Chapter 4 of <i>Artful Design</i>,
				Programmability and Sound <b>Design</b>. <br />
				<br />
				I will be responding to Principle 4.1: Programming is a
				<b>Creative</b> Endeavor.<br />
				<br />
				Chapter 4 of <i>Artful Design</i> emphasizes the power which
				programming grants us to materialize things which might have
				otherwise been confined to one's imagination. The tools of a
				painter – assortments brushes and paints, give the ability to
				realize powerful images which can last millennia. The tools of a
				singer provide a conduit to express emotion in conjunction with
				the fine intricacies of the physiology of the vocal track. The
				tools of a programmer, however, grant us the ability to
				transcend domains and create interdisciplinary.<br />

				I am a classically trained violinist. I am also somewhat of a
				chef. To cook a divine meal, one needs a recipe, the ingredients
				of said recipe, and the proper execution of the recipe. Playing
				the violin can be thought of in a similar fashion. The
				ingredients to an ethereal sound from a perfectly oscillating
				string include intonation, a proper stance and grip of the
				instrument, and an even bow-stroke with a balance of pressure
				and speed. However, the crucial element which enables one to
				create for themselves instead of systematically following a
				score is developing an ear for feedback. The continuous cycle of
				design-to-execution to feedback-to-design is elemental in
				turning programming from a robotic task into a
				<b>creative endeavor</b>. Such a method allows creativity in the
				domain of music to be applied in an environment independent of
				any one instrument.<br />
				<br />
				During the winter of my freshman year at Stanford I took CS106A
				with Chris Piech. Perhaps the most prolific class at Stanford,
				both at the undergraduate and graduate level, CS106A is the
				introductory class to computer science. It was in that class I
				was first introduced to “programming as a multidisciplinary tool
				to create” as a school of thought. However, reflecting on
				Chapter 4 from <i>Artful Design</i>, I liken programming to a
				musical instrument more than to an engineering tool. There is an
				art to the act of programming as well as the product. Just as
				feedback from a musical instrument is crucial to adjust
				dynamics, speed, and intonation, feedback during the development
				process of programming is what turns a build from a compiler
				simply executing a series of instructions, to a creative
				endeavor. I believe the following quote taken from Chapter 4 of
				<i>Artful Design</i> embodies this philosophy completely:<br />
				<br />
				<b
					>“No matter how advanced the technology, it takes human
					intentionality to use the computer as a tool and a
					laboratory for new ideas,” (pg. 184).</b
				><br />
				<br />
				As I increasingly find myself claustrophobic with computers as
				my tools, my instrument, and my voice, I find space in the fact
				that the real power of a computer is the human intentionality
				which wields it.<br />
