      <h3>A Final Note</h3>
      <p>
        I began this project with the goal of creating a music experience
        explored through the traditional <i>Operation</i> paradigm.
        <b><i>Musical Operation</i></b> uses Chunity to audibly reflect the
        state of health of the patient which is a cumulative result of the
        organs and and vitals of the patient. The user is able to interact with
        either, allowing infinite posibilities of feedback. More severe vitals
        will yield dissonant sounds based off dimished chords. On the other
        hand, stable vitals will modulate towards minor, then major, and finally
        a pentatonic scale. Using different combinations of organs, and
        different dial settings, one can achieve a wide range of sounds out of
        my project. ChucK runs an algorithm which interprets the values of vital
        signs and reflects the corresponding stability or unstablility of the
        patient through the organs which each operate as their own synthesizer,
        being activated when placed in the patient. One point I would like to
        emphasize is that when the brain or heart are placed on the scale, the
        track which plays is a biosignal dataset of blood presure and skin
        conductivity over time which I analyzed. The actual physiological marker
        values were quantized to a C major scale and then stored as MIDI data.
        In the backgroud of the scene one can see a white object with black
        scribbles on it. This is a fragment of the visual representation of the
        processed biodata.
