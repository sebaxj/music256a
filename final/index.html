        <li>Expanding upon the ECG Sequencer</li>
        <img src="./assets/ecg.jpg" alt="ecg" width="700" height="380" /><br />
        <p>
          This idea proposes expanding upon by music sequencer by adding more
          dimensions than just a heart monitor. In this version, I would have a
          monitor for pulse-ox, temperature, blood pressure, and brain activity
          (in the form of an EEG trace) which I would be able to manipulate to
          create sequences. Each variable would control a different instrument
          with its timbre embodying that vital sign.

        <li>Operation</li>

        /><br />
        <p>
          I would like to create a musical operation. Just like the original
          <i>Operation</i> game, one would be able to drag and drop human body
          parts to "build" up a musical piece. The game would act as a
          <b>granular synthesis</b> tool. Each body part would correspond to a
          specific type of sound. For example, the hear would create a kick
          drum, the brain would create an ethereal jumping melody, the lungs
          would create a breathy organ sound, and so on. The game would have
          certain rules you may implement as well, such as starting with a
          complete body with all the organs already placed and being able to
          <b>remove</b> body parts.

        <li>Light City</li>
        <img
          src="./assets/light_city.jpg"
          alt="light city"
          width="700"
          height="600"
        /><br />
        <p>
          This is my least developed idea. In this one, I am envisioning an
          array of light bulbs or candles, with flickering lights. One would be
          able to zoom in on a specific candle or light bulb, and manipulate it
          in some way. This may include stretching it out length-wise to create
          higher frequency notes, or stretching it out width-wise to create
          lower frequency notes. One would initiate sounds by either lighting a
          candle and controlling the flickering flame (using wind or water to
          alter how big, small, constant, or ephemeral it is), or by plucking
          the filament of a light bulb like a string.
