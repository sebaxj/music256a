        So far, I have the scaffold of my scene complete, as well as the piping
        between Unity and ChucK. Unity keeps track of where each organ is. Once
        an organ is placed in the <b>RIGHT</b> slot, Unity changes a global
        variable in ChucK – via an event – which maps to each organ. To put it
        simply, when an organ is in its slot, the corresponding audio features
        are added to the backing track in ChucK. Once an organ is "thrown out",
        Unity instructs ChucK to remove that sound from the backing track.
      </p>
      <p>
      Next, I indend to add the following:
      <ul>
          <li>More organs (liver, kidney, stomache, etc.)</li>
          <li>A vital monitor to control the rate of heart beat, brain activty, etc.</li>
          <li>A main menu where you can chose between two modes: empty body where you add, full body where you take organs out.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

        <li>Expanding upon the ECG Sequencer</li>
        <img src="./assets/ecg.jpg" alt="ecg" width="700" height="380" /><br />
        <p>
          This idea proposes expanding upon by music sequencer by adding more
          dimensions than just a heart monitor. In this version, I would have a
          monitor for pulse-ox, temperature, blood pressure, and brain activity
          (in the form of an EEG trace) which I would be able to manipulate to
          create sequences. Each variable would control a different instrument
          with its timbre embodying that vital sign.
        </p>
        <li>Operation</li>
        <img
          src="./assets/operation.jpg"
          alt="operation"
          width="500"
          height="380"
        /><br />
        <p>
          I would like to create a musical operation. Just like the original
          <i>Operation</i> game, one would be able to drag and drop human body
          parts to "build" up a musical piece. The game would act as a
          <b>granular synthesis</b> tool. Each body part would correspond to a
          specific type of sound. For example, the hear would create a kick
          drum, the brain would create an ethereal jumping melody, the lungs
          would create a breathy organ sound, and so on. The game would have
          certain rules you may implement as well, such as starting with a
          complete body with all the organs already placed and being able to
          <b>remove</b> body parts.
        </p>
        <li>Light City</li>
        <img
          src="./assets/light_city.jpg"
          alt="light city"
          width="700"
          height="600"
        /><br />
        <p>
          This is my least developed idea. In this one, I am envisioning an
          array of light bulbs or candles, with flickering lights. One would be
          able to zoom in on a specific candle or light bulb, and manipulate it
          in some way. This may include stretching it out length-wise to create
          higher frequency notes, or stretching it out width-wise to create
          lower frequency notes. One would initiate sounds by either lighting a
          candle and controlling the flickering flame (using wind or water to
          alter how big, small, constant, or ephemeral it is), or by plucking
          the filament of a light bulb like a string.
