      <h3>A Final Note</h3>
      <p>
        I modeled my visualizer after an electrocardiogram (ECG). Studying both
        premed and music, I often find myself straddled between two worlds.
        However, I found that this project gave me an opportunity to attempt to
        <b>"sonify"</b> medicine. I wanted to create a visualizer which could,
        yes, create music in the same way a MIDI synthesizer can, but which also
        could take pre existing models and biodata and <b>"sonify"</b> it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Being brutally honest, I did not enjoy starting this project. I
        constantly felt like I knew enough to do <i>something</i>, but
        <i>NOT</i> enough to do what I wanted. I found the disconnect between C#
        scripting and ChucK code very confusing at first. In fact, I rewrote my
        code several times in order to better understand how everything was
        connected. However, just like with most projects, there came a time when
        it suddenly "clicked". My creative freedom was able to take charge and I
        was no longer hindered by trivial tasks such as figuring out how a
        button works. I found myself spending more time attending to my strength
        of coding as opposed to being frustrated by my weakness of not being
        able to 3D model. Once I fully grasped the interaction between Unit and
        ChucK via <code>global variables</code>, I found that my workflow
        between building a graphical interface and driving it via a ChucK script
        to actually become fun. I do, however, wish we had more time. I felt
        like just as I had "cracked" this assignment, it was due. As I am
        handing it in, my mind is flooding with possibilities of feature I wish
        I had added â€“ I will hold onto those possibilities for the final
        project.
        <br />
        <br />
        I did not use any pre-existing assets.
