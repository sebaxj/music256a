      <p>
        As suggested, the <i>Chickenser</i> tutorial was useful to learn about 
        audio-driven events as opposed to graphical driven. However, I simply 
        watched the tutorial to learn about audio-driven events, not to set up 
        my starter project. Beyond that, I plan to start from scratch as opposed 
        to copying and pasting some of the tutorial code.

      <p>
        It appears that at the most basic definition, a music sequencer is a 
        set of software or hardware which can record and/or playback a series 
        of notes programmed by a musician. One of the first sequencers in "Western 
        Music" was the piano roll. I found the piano roll a simple example to learn 
        about what should/shouldn't be the capability of a music sequencer. Furthermore, 
        it appears that the evolution of music sequencers has gradually favored software 
        over hardware, eventually bringing us MIDI. As such, I want to use the music 
        sequencer project to explore how the literal, physiological aspects of human are 
        responsible for music just as is the higher level cortex we have developed over millions 
        of years of evolution.
