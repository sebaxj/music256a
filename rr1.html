				This is a response to Chapter 1 of <i>Artful Design</i>, "Design
				is ____". <br />
				<br />
				I will be responding to Principle 1.13, <b>Design is Human</b
				><br />
				<br />
				<b>Design is Human</b> (pg. 46). I thought it fitting to start
				with this definition of design which is presented to us in
				Chapter 1, especially as it conflicts with what I once thought
				of as design, and what I still think of as design. Firstly, I
				would like to treat design as an entity entirely separate from
				the intentions and forces of humanity. I believe there are
				traits we share with design, and traits we don’t. However, I
				believe that our definition of design is solely based on the
				traits we see common to ourselves, juxtaposed to anything we
				“design”. For example, the epitome of human beauty has long been
				considered a product of symmetry; the more symmetrical one’s
				face and body, the more objective beauty they have. The same can
				be said about design, both natural and artificial – flowers,
				ferns, and honeycombs all exemplify natural symmetry. The same
				can be said about pyramids, ancient buildings, and bridges. From
				this we may assume that humans aren’t the only architects of
				design. Rather, “Design is created. Design is experienced.
				Design is a thing in motion” (pg 51). I believe that just as we
				design buildings, paint art, play music, and program software,
				the constantly designing natural world has its turn in shaping
				humanity. We can’t be so foolish as to believe that design isn’t
				observing us as well, as stated in Chapter 1 of
				<i>Artful Design</i>. When I was younger I remember watching
				<b>The Night in the Museum</b> with my family and still to this
				day questioning if the world around us is in fact as it appears
				to us, or if its true form is outside the dimensions of human
				perception, or if in fact we as humans are the subjects of other
				entities looking in on us when we least expect it. <br />
				<br />
				Rather than design being human, it appears to me as a conduit
				through which we conceive emotions into action. For example, we
				devise a function to progress “as a society”. Over time, the
				jobs of painters, musicians, architects, poets, and philosophers
				has been to create a form for that function which enhances its
				usefulness. As stated in Chapter 1 of <i>Artful Design</i>, form
				and function operate in an infinite feedback loop, but only once
				we are satisfied with both may we begin the cycle over again,
				devising a new function. I liken the lifecycle of design to
				<b>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</b> – in order for a person to
				achieve more, they must first have the basics. Shelter, food,
				exercise, and self esteem are all needed before one can love
				deeply, learn, and elicit creativity. Back in terms of design,
				one can’t simply create endlessly without taking the (sometimes
				monotonous) time to sculpt and evolve the form into function;
				like a Renaissance sculptor chipping out what is not to leave
				what is supposed to be. <br />
				<br />
				Reading and reflecting on this chapter gave me assurance that
				there is not only a desire for design to “artify” our
				surroundings and make what we do everyday more enjoyable, but
				also a need for that function to be well designed: we need to
				FEEL it, become INSPIRED by it, become CURIOUS because of it.
				One of my (yet-to-be-enforced) New Year’s Resolutions was to do
				less, but do more with purpose. It seems that
				<i>Artful Design</i> is a paradigm to put more “purpose” into
				what I do and to NOT treat everything like boxes on a check
				list. <br />

				My Violin: <br />
				I believe that my violin is the epitome of the dichotomy between
				means-to-an-end and end-in-itself. Without form, there would be
				no function beyond kindling for fire on a desperate, cold,
				Vermont winter night. However, without function, the form would
				be incomprehensible. The balance between form and function and
				function and form is the signature of the luthier, and
				foundation of my relationship with the instrument.
				Interestingly, however, one needs not understand both to
				experience both. If one were to close their eyes, the function
				they hear would well inform the expected form. If I were to see
				the violin on display, I would have an expectation of the
				function I would hear from the instrument. <br />

				<br />
				My weightlifting shoes: <br />
				There are those who believe that shoes merely serve the purpose
				of covering our feet, and there are those who buy shoes, put
				them in glass cases, never to be worn. I don’t fall into either
				camp. My weightlifting shoes are built with purpose – I bought
				them for the very purpose they were created for. However, over
				time, I have come to realize an emotional connection to every
				scuff mark, imperfection, and horrid smell connected to the
				pair. They are not the shoes I bought – they are my shoes. Their
				beauty to me far surpasses any superficial desire to mend or
				replace them – at least not until absolutely necessary. They are
				a functional design as opposed to a well-designed function.

				<br />
				My room: <br />
				My room falls under the category of “controlled mess”. My room
				doesn’t take on one, two, or three functions. There aren’t
				enough words to describe what functions my room offers me. It is
				a creative studio when I feel claustrophobic. It is an escape
				when I feel overwhelmed. It is nothing when I have too much. It
				is safe when I feel I have nothing. My room is my ongoing
				experiment into <i>Artful Design</i>. I alter my room to take on
				various forms and functions to fit my needs and desires, both
				present and future. My room has four walls which everyone can
				see, but only I know of the deep crevasses which truly give my
				room its power and character. <br />

			<h4 id="part3-guerilla">Guerilla Design: A Text Message</h4>
			<p>
				For the final part of Design Etude #1, I present a text message
				to my roommate which has been "artified". Instead of summarizing
				my day (or just sending an audio message if I'm feeling EXTRA
				lazy), I decided to add another dimension: DESIGN.
