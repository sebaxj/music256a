				This is a response to Chapter 7 of <i>Artful Design</i>, Social
				<b>Design</b>.<br />
				<br />
				I will be responding to Principle 7.14: Whatever you do, do it
				with
				<b>Authenticity</b><br />
				<br />
				“Who is that out there?”<br />
				“Does it <b>really</b> matter?”<br />
				“Or is it enough simply to know it’s another person out
				there?”<br />
				<br />
				<i>– pg. 362 of Artful Design</i><br />
				<br />
				Chapter 7 starts by postulating a series of questions about the
				social domain. If we are to consider a social system as a
				function, where there is human input with the intention of being
				heard by human output, is it “good enough” to know you have a
				witness? Or must we know exactly
				<i>who</i> it is out there? Social design, as explored in
				Chapter 7, is concerned with the dynamics, qualities, and
				authenticity of human-human interaction through the domain of
				technology. <br />
				<br />
				Games with a purpose (GWAPs) are an application of human
				computation designed to explore the <b>limits</b> of computer
				intelligence, and the <b>limitless</b> potential of human
				intelligence. Though GWAPs utilize technological innovation, the
				design is ultimately used by humans. Technology might be the
				medium, the domain, but humanity is the donor and the recipient.
				This is a school of thought which I will explore further in this
				essay.<br />
				<br />
				Before writing this response, I spent some time researching
				<b><i>The Human Condition</i></b
				>; the essentials of human existence starting with birth,
				growth, emotion, aspiration, conflict, and ultimately, accepting
				mortality. In particular, the phrase
				<i>"The Human Condition"</i> has been used by R&B artist Jon
				Bellion for his 2016 album of the same name, and by Belgian
				surrealist René Magritte to refer to a series of two paintings
				which can be seen at the top of this webpage. In Jon Bellion’s
				album, <i>The Human Condition</i>, he uses his voice as an
				instrument in all manners – percussively, synthetically, and
				chorally, to name a few. Bellion strips his album down to a key
				element to embrace our common humanity: the voice. Magritte’s
				paintings both contain a <i>“real”</i> landscape seen through a
				window, an easel, and a canvas which covers part of the window
				and depicts the hidden portion of the landscape; it is a classic
				painting within a painting. One might easily conclude that the
				fictitious canvas is simply a depiction of the portion of
				landscape outside the window which is hidden from our view.
				However, this interpretation is ultimately false as the entire
				canvas, as it exists in our plane, is in fact all a fabrication
				of reality. There is no difference between the
				<i>“real”</i> imagery in the painting and the representation of
				that reality on the easel; from our viewpoint, everything in the
				painting is fictitious relative to everything outside the
				painting. I believe that these two examples, one from a century
				ago and one from only a few years ago, embody
				<b>Principle 7.14</b> of <i>Artful Design</i>, “whatever you do,
				do it with authenticity,”. Though the works I have presented
				appear to be complex deceptions, they are in fact the epitome of
				designing for human connection as an end in itself. They may
				exist in the technological sphere as music streams or digital
				captures of oil canvases, but only a human is able to unwind the
				complex entanglement of the human condition which they
				explore.<br />
				<br />
				As I finish the Music Sequencer assignment in Music 256A and
				begin to think about the final assignment, I am continuing to
				find a balance between the complexity of a task for both humans
				and computers, while maintaining a wall of abstraction between
				the complexity of a task for me, the designer, and that of the
				general user.<br />
