          Design usually begins, unpleasantly and messily, in a sea of

        This is a response to Chapter 3 of <i>Artful Design</i>,
        <b>Visual Design</b>. <br />

        I will be responding to Principle 3.5: Build <b>Complexity</b> from

      <i>Red Rock Canyon – Morgan Madeleine Photography</i>
      <p>
        Recently I was in Red Rock Canyon State Park. From afar, the stunning
        textured rocks are draped in alternating tones of deep and light red
        from years of iron oxidation; They appear almost Martian. The colors
        appear to be the result of red food coloring sprayed with precision by
        giants. However, as you approach the park, distinct lines begin to
        emerge. It is not until you park, leave your car, walk down the
        treacherous pathways of scree, that one is able to see that in fact, the
        lines are made of many splotches of oxidized iron in the rock. Though a
        function of the entropy of creation, the small, imperfect circles of red
        form a larger, more defined line. These lines, spaced seemingly so
        evenly, work to create a system of design which appears as a grand and
        organized monument.<br />
        <br />
        Chapter 3 teaches us the design process, riddled with feedback,
        iteration, recursion, and embodiment. Function gives rise to form and
        motion which manifests personality. This cascade can be called an
        element – many of which assemble into a system which presents a
        narrative to the human experience which in turn interacts with the
        system. There appears to be a common element both to the principles of
        visual design set forth in Chapter 3 of <i>Artful Design</i>, and the
        puzzle parts of nature which work in commonality to reveal the
        <b>sublime</b>. That element is <b>illusion</b>. Small circles of
        oxidized iron appear from afar to be rocks draped in red curtains, just
        as thousands of pixels in a screen display coordinated colors at fast
        time intervals to portray motion from stationary parts.
        <b>Zeno’s Interpolator</b> computes intermediate values between still
        data points to embody continuity and smoothness. However, it is an
        illusion which gives rise to personality in the inanimate.<br />
        <br />
        I am haunted by the question of whether or not humans perceive what is
        absolute in the universe, or if we live with faulty senses. If we are to
        say that design, both natural and artificial, is born from the
        manipulation of illusion, then is there anything which appears to us in
        its truest form?
